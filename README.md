Boostrap contact form for Joomla 3x
============
Hi guys, this is my version of the "Working Bootstrap Contact Form With PHP" of Bootstrapbay (https://github.com/bootstrapbay/contact-form). I made this to work out-of-the-box in a Joomla 3x articles.

You can simply copy and paste the code into the article editor and the form will work. It still needs some work in the PHP response but it's a good strart for everyone. 
IMPORTANT: the "sourcerer" Joomla exstension must be installed to work (link: http://extensions.joomla.org/extension/sourcerer).

Enjoy.
